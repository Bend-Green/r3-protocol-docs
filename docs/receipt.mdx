# Receipt Object

The receipt object defines a transaction. A receipt consists of both the ‘header’ information, as well as the ‘line item’ details. For example: a receipt from a coffee shop would include the header information — the merchant, the date, the total amount of the purchase, etc. — and the line items — 2 x drip coffees, 1 x donut, etc. For a receipt to be valid, the sum of all the line items must exactly add up to the header total.

## Rceipt Header

A receipt header object looks like this:

```
{
  "authorization": "auth_1MzFN1K8F4fqH0lBmFq8CjbU",
  "amount": 12345,
  "created": 1682065867,
  "merchant_id": "merchant_1MzFN1K8F4fqH0lBmFq8CjbU",
  "details": [

  ]
}
```
