# R3 Registry

The Registry is the centralized and trusted service operated by R3P. Its primary responsibilities are
1. the registration of BIN receiver addresses, and providing authorized addresses to senders
2. the registration of transaction hash/key pairs, and providing keys to authorized receivers
3. the cataloguing of entity brand details, such that sellers can control the appearance of their receipts
